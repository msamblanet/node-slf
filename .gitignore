# IF USING A PRIVATE REPOSITORY CACHE (such as Verdaccio), then
# as of NPM 7, this breaks when other people try to ```npm i```
# with package-lock.json - See https://verdaccio.org/docs/cli-registry#npm-7x
# If your team makes any uses of such caches and any library
# consumer does not have access, ensure your exclude package-lock.json
#
# If you use a private cache that not all consumers have access to,
# you should uncomment this exclude.
